# Project Name: Dine Dash

## Tagline

Savor the Flavor, Effortlessly Delivered

## Team

- Kelvin Njuiri: Full stack Engineer
- Daisy Mumbo: Full stack Engineer

## Roles

Kelvin Njuiri and Daisy Mumbo, both serving as Full stack Engineers, will collaboratively handle both frontend and backend development tasks. This division allows for a holistic approach to project development, with each team member contributing to all aspects of the application, from user interface design to server-side logic implementation. The decision to assign both team members as Full stack Engineers reflects their comprehensive skill set and ensures flexibility in addressing various project requirements.

## Technologies

- Languages: JavaScript (ES6+)
- Frontend Framework: React.js
- Backend Framework: Next.js
- Database: Sanity
- Deployment: Vercel

### Alternative Technology Choices

- Backend Framework: An alternative to Next.js could be Express.js, a minimalist Node.js web application framework. While Express.js offers more flexibility and control over server configurations, Next.js provides built-in features for server-side rendering, routing, and API handling, streamlining development and deployment processes. The decision to use Next.js was based on its seamless integration with React and its suitability for building scalable and SEO-friendly web applications.
- Database: Instead of Sanity, MongoDB could be considered for database management. MongoDB is known for its flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured data. However, Sanity offers structured content management capabilities and real-time collaboration features, making it well-suited for content-heavy applications like a pizza delivery platform. The decision to use Sanity was driven by its ability to efficiently manage menu items, orders, and user data in a structured format, enhancing development speed and content management capabilities.

### Problem Statement

Dine Dash aims to connect customers with their favorite foods, providing a convenient and efficient solution for busy individuals, families, and office workers.

### What FUDO Will Not Solve

Dine Dash will not address the challenges associated with food preparation, quality control, or delivery logistics at partner restaurants. While the platform aims to streamline the ordering and delivery process for customers, it does not directly influence the food quality, preparation time, or delivery speed at participating restaurants.

### Target Users

Dine Dash will cater to busy individuals, families, and office workers seeking convenient and hassle-free food delivery options. It will also benefit restaurants and food vendors looking to expand their customer reach and streamline their delivery operations.

## Risks

- **Technical Complexity**: Developing a seamless ordering and delivery platform requires integrating various frontend and backend technologies, handling real-time data updates, and ensuring secure payment processing. Addressing these technical challenges may require additional time and resources.
- **User Adoption**: Convincing users to switch from existing food delivery platforms to Dine Dash may be challenging due to established competitors in the market. Providing unique features, competitive pricing, and exceptional customer service will be essential to attract and retain users.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with local food safety regulations, data protection laws, and payment processing standards is crucial for operating a food delivery platform. Staying informed about legal requirements and implementing necessary safeguards will be essential to avoid legal issues.
